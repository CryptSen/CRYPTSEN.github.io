## Features

GraphSense is an open source platform for analyzing cryptocurrencies
such as [Bitcoin][bitcoin].

- **Address Clustering**: partition the set of addresses observed in a cryptocurrency
ecosystem into maximal subsets (clusters) that are likely to be controlled by the same
real-world entity.

- **Micro- and Macroscopic Analysis**: inspect main cryptocurrency entities
(block, transaction, address) and compute summary statistics over the entire
blockchain.

- **Network Perspective**: apply a network-centric perspective and traverse currency
flows between addresses and clusters.

- **Horizontal Scalability**: cryptocurrency blockchains [are growing][blockchain.info]
and new currencies [appear on the horizon][coinmarketcap]. To make GraphSense
future-proof, it is built on [Apache Spark][spark] and [Cassandra][cassandra] for
horizontal scalability.

## Example

The following example shows details about an example Bitcoin address.

## Technical Architecture

GraphSense provides a number of software components:

- [dashboard][dashboard]: a user-interface allowing search, inspection, and traversal of cryptocurrency entities

- [rest-api][rest-api]: an API for retrieving data from the underlying Cassandra store

- [transformation][transformation]: a Spark pipeline for computing statistics and network representations from raw blockchain data stored in Cassandra.

- [datafeed][datafeed]: a component for ingesting raw blockchain data and exchange rates into Cassandra

- [bitcoin-client][bitcoin-client]: a Docker container encapsuling the most-recent Bitcoin client version
