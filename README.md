*Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency, which can be used to execute
pseudo-anonymous payments globally within a short period of time and
comparably low transaction costs. In this paper, we present initial
results of a longitudinal study conducted over the Bitcoin address graph,
which contains all addresses and transactions from the beginning of
Bitcoin in January 2009 until 31st of August 2016. Our analysis reveals a
highly-skewed degree distribution with a small number of outliers and
illustrates that the entire graph is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, it
demonstrates the power of address clustering heuristics for identifying
real-world actors, who prefer to use Bitcoin for transferring rather than
storing value. We believe that this paper provides novel insight into
virtual currency ecosystems, which can inform the design of future
analytics methods and infrastructures.*

*Bitcoin is a rising digital currency and exemplifies the growing need for
systematically gathering and analyzing public transaction data sets such
as the blockchain. However, the blockchain in its raw form is just a large
ledger listing transfers of currency units between alphanumeric character
strings, without revealing contextually relevant real-world information.
In this demo, we present GraphSense, which is a solution that applies a
graph-centric perspective on digital currency transactions. It allows
users to explore transactions and follow the money flow, facilitates
analytics by semantically enriching the transaction graph, supports path
and graph pattern search, and guides analysts to anomalous data points. To
deal with the growing volume and velocity of transaction data, we
implemented our solution on a horizontally scalable data processing and
analytics infrastructure. Given the ongoing digital transformation in
financial services and technologies, we believe that our approach
contributes to development of analytics solutions for digital currency
ecosystems, which is relevant in fields such as financial analytics, law
enforcement, or scientific research.*

**On finding the k shortest paths in RDF data.**

*Finding relationships between entities in RDF data is in the heart of
many exploration tasks. General path enumeration algorithms are typically
used for computing such relationships, nding top k short-est paths being
of special interest. The k shortest paths problem has been thoroughly
studied for the weighted graph case, the two most pop-ular generic
algorithms are due to Eppstein and to Yen. Along with the Dijkstra’s
shortest path algorithm upon which they build, these two algorithms are
available in most libraries and graph databases. In the RDF context,
however, the graph is unlabeled but can have multi-edges, and the found
paths can contain cycles, so applying the mentioned algorithms is either
impossible (Yen’s) or suboptimal. It is a folklore knowledge that the
traditional breadth rst search (BFS) can be easily adapted to compute the
k shortest paths. However, for dense graphs and large k, both time and
memory consumption become critical. We discuss two BFS adaptations which
are easy to implement and substantially boost performance when solving the
k shortest paths problem.*
